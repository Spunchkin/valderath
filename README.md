## FAQ

#### Is the project finished

Answer: No, I am currently working on it, many parts of it are unfinished.

#### Why is the program only one file

Answer: Since the program is still relatively small, i dont currently see a need for that, i will probably put the class and other things in other files to improve readability.

im generally pretty new to c++ and dont code in it much, this program has some unused imports and other bad practices
I will try my best to improve, this was a dumb project, but was really fun while it lasted, thanks for your attention!!
